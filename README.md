-ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Awelani Munzhelele, a passionate Mathematics and Computer Science student at the University of Johannesburg ðŸŽ“. Fascinated by the intersection of numbers and algorithms, I'm on a journey to explore the depths of both theoretical and applied aspects of mathematics and computer science.

ðŸ’» As a coder, I love diving into complex algorithms and solving intriguing problems. From crafting elegant solutions in Python to exploring the world of data structures and algorithms, I'm always eager to learn and grow.

ðŸ“š When I'm not coding, you'll find me buried in textbooks, exploring new mathematical concepts or tinkering with coding projects. Whether it's developing software applications or analyzing mathematical theories, I thrive on the challenge of turning ideas into reality.

ðŸŒŸ Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects, share insights, and geek out over all things math and code! Feel free to reach out and let's embark on this journey together ðŸš€
